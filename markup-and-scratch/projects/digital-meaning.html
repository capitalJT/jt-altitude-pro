                    <p>With Jabal, you don’t just get a UX designer and front-end web developer. You get a process improver. A doer, because he’s never sitting around waiting for something to happen or get assigned. He’s an effective, direct communicator, which can’t be underestimated when you have clients who don’t always know how to put into words what they really want. Our clients positively swoon at everything he delivers.</p>
