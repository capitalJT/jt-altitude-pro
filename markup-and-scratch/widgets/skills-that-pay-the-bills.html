            <h3>UX Design</h3>
            <p>I am creative at my core. I thrive in the space between strategic thinking and designing. My creative passion surfaces in many forms, from hands-on design/development and producing, to music, technology, and photography.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>I enjoy puzzles and problem solving. One of most satisfying aspects of being a developer is seeing code you wrote deployed in a live system and used by actual people, especially if it improves their lives in some way.</p>

            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            <p>I believe in data + creative, not data vs creative. I find the most success when the two inform each other. My most effective and impactful work has been open to change and creative evolution, while still being transparent and measurable.</p>
