                    <h3>UX Design</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy researching and using design to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. I love thinking through use cases, testing them out and then communicating a user’s journey. UX design allows me to bridge the gap between technology and&nbsp;people.</p>

                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>I’ve always been attracted to puzzles and figuring out how things work. One of the most satisfying aspects of being a developer is seeing my code deployed in a live system and used by actual people, especially if it improves their lives in some&nbsp;way.</p>

                    <p>I believe in data + creative, not data vs creative. I find the most success when the two inform each other. My most effective and impactful work has been open to change and creative evolution, while still being transparent and&nbsp;measurable.</p>
