While consulting for Better World Advertising, an SF design agency, I redesigned the UI and UX for INPUD. My goal was to provide clean, modern, and intuitive designs. For this project I created detailed interaction work flows, wireframes, mock-ups and prototypes to demonstrate design intent and communicate with clients.
