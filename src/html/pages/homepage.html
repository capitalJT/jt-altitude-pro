            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>I am creative at my core. I find inspiration from people and experiences. I thrive in the space between strategic thinking and designing. My creative passion surfaces in many forms, from hands-on design/development and producing, to music, technology, and photography.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>I enjoy puzzles and problem solving. Although I like to make the things we interact with look aesthetically pretty, I also like to build those things with longevity, scalability, and to simply work.</p>

            <h3>Marketing</h3>
            <p>I believe in data and creative, not data vs creative. I find the most success when the two inform each other. My most effective and impactful work has been open to change and creative evolution, while still being transparent and measurable.</p>

                            <p>With Jabal, you don’t just get a UX designer and front-end web developer. You get a process improver. A doer, because he’s never sitting around waiting for something to happen or get assigned. He’s an effective, direct communicator, which can’t be underestimated when you have clients who don’t always know how to put into words what they really want. No job or task is beneath him, and his passion and enthusiasm are something to admire and emulate. Our clients positively swoon at everything he delivers.</p>
