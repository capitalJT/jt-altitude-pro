One of the projects I've worked on with Al Jazeera was the redesign and redevelopment of their Training Centre site. I was an advocate for user-centered design as a corporate vision and supported UX consistency across brand divisions. I worked in tandem with product managers and designers to create effective UI and UX solutions that supported business requirements. 

My role in this project included creating wireframes, hi-res mock-ups and developing prototypes. Once the prototypes passed QA and gained internal stakeholders approval I worked with the platforms team to implement the templates and modules into their content management system.

The main objectives were to make the site responsive and refactor the codebase to include design patterns from their design language system.
