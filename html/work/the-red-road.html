At <a href="http://therefinerycreative.com/" target="_blank">The Refinery</a> I conceptualized the static and interactive campaigns for the premiere of Sundance Channelâ€™s The Red Road. The designs were based on the final key art and identity. I worked closely with lead art director to create the final deliverables for the advertisement banners and skins. This was the digital arm of a full 360 integrated campaign from outdoor, print, digital and television.
