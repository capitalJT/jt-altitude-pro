Lead Designer & Developer for Al Jazeera’s Design Language System. I’ve created a resource for designers, product managers, and developers, providing a common language around Al Jazeera’s UI patterns. The Design Language System is an internal living document that ensures visual consistency across the media network.

While working on the DLS I’ve collaborated with the design, products, and platforms teams, gathered feedback and iterated to build a design foundation for a consistent brand within their online presence and digital products.

The DLS is build with Zurb Foundation, HTML5 markup, PHP includes, SASS mixins, and JavaScript.
