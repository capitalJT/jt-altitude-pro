<div class="about">
	<p>Howdy! My name is Jabal but friends call me JT. I'm a San Francisco Bay Area UI / UX Designer and Front-End Developer. I'm open source, cross-browser compatible and user friendly.</p>
	<p>While interface design and prototyping with HTML, SASS, and JavaScript are some of my core strengths, youâ€™ll often find me participating in discussions with team members about technical best practices and user experience design trends. I have a relentless hunger for knowledge. I'm passionate about responsive design, elegant code, and beautiful typography.</p>
	<p>In my free time I enjoy cycling and learning about new technologies.</p>
